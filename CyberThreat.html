<b>Types of Cyber Attacks</b></font>
<br>
<font size="5">
Cyber threats come in a variety of forms and kinds. Some are overt ransomware assaults (hijacking critical company products or tools in exchange for money to unlock them), while others are stealthy operations in which criminals infiltrate a system to steal vital data, only to be detected months later, if at all. Criminals are becoming more sophisticated in their acts, and here are some of the most common sorts of cyber attacks that harm thousands of individuals every day.

<b>Malware</b></font>
<br>
<font size="5">
The term malware refers to malicious software such as spyware, ransomware, and viruses. It usually invades networks by exploiting a flaw, such as clicking on suspicious email links or installing a dangerous application. Malware can gather important information once within a network, as well as develop additional dangerous software throughout the system and even block access to critical corporate network components (ransomware). Malware comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, including:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Virus: A self-replicating program that infects files with harmful code after attaching itself to a clean file and spreading throughtout a computer system. </li>
  <br>
  <li>Trojan horses: Malware that masquerades as legitimate software. Users are duped into downloading. Trojans onto their compters, which then infict damage or collect data.</li><br>
  <li>Spyware is a type of software that secretly records what a user does so that hackers can profit from it.Spyware, for example, could record credit card information.</li><br>
  <li>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user's files and data and threatens to delete them unless aransom is paid.</li><br>
  <li>Adware is a type of advertising software that can be used  to distribute malware.</li><br>
  <li>Botnets are malware-infected computer networks that fraudsters employ to accomplish tasks online without the user's knowledge or consent.</li><br></ul></font>

  	<b>Phishing</b>
  </font><br>
<font size="5">
Phishing is the act of sending malicious communications (often emails) that appear to come from well-known, legitimate sources. To assuage doubts and persuade victims to click on dangerous links, these emails imitate the same names, logos, phrasing, and so on as a CEO or company. When a phishing link is clicked, cyber criminals have access to personal information such as credit cards, social security numbers, and login credentials.</font>
</ul>  <br><br><br>
<font size="6">
  	<b>Social engineering</b>
  </font><br>
<font size="5">
The process of mentally manipulating someone into giving personal information is known as social engineering. Phishing is a type of social engineering in which thieves use people's natural curiosity or trust to their advantage. Voice manipulation is an example of more advanced social engineering. In this example, cyber fraudsters use a person's voice (from sources such as a voicemail or a social media post) to phone friends or family and request credit card or other personal information.</font><br><br><br>
<font size="6">
  	<b>Man-in-the-Middle Attack</b>
  </font><br>	
<font size="5">
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks occur when criminals interfere with a two-party transaction's traffic. Criminals, for example, can place themselves between a public Wi-Fi network and a user's device. Cyber crooks can occasionally read all of a victim's information without ever being discovered if they don't have access to a secure Wi-Fi connection.
</font><br><br><br>
<font size="6">
  	<b>Zero-day attack</b>
  </font><br>
 <font size="5">
 Zero-day cyberattacks are getting more widespread by the day. These assaults take place between the notification of a network vulnerability and the application of a patch solution. Most firms will announce that they have discovered a flaw with their network security in the sake of transparency and security, but some criminals will use this chance to launch attacks before the company can provide a security fix.
